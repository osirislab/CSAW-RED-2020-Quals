# Description

This challenge is the next iteration of the spellcoding challenges.
The user gets some null bytes placed in the middle of their shellcode, so they have to 
execute a short jump past those bytes to execute the code. It is a bump up because 
now they have to understand shellcode, not just run it. Also, 
this time I am not providing source code. Story: get into 
370 Jay Street, 10th floor. The challenge is D&D themed because 
all good challenges are D&D themed. The spells are straight 
out of the Player's Handbook and the puns are the best D&D 
puns ever used in a CSAW RED 2020 CTF 2nd-level shellcoding challenge.

# TODO

Just needs to be tested once it's running in CTFd. Also note that I have it running on port 8000, following the example of other challenges waiting to be assigned unique port numbers.
