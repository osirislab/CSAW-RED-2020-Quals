# Description

This challenge requires the user to run 32-bit shellcode. The stack is executable, the user enters the shellcode and it gets run. Source code is provided so the user doesn't have to reverse engineer all the fluff. I gave compilation instructions to the players in the source code. It's D&D-themed because why not. The use of the "spellcode" idea is not original.

# TODO

Just needs to be tested once it's running in CTFd. Also note that I have it running on port 8000, following the example of other challenges waiting to be assigned unique port numbers
