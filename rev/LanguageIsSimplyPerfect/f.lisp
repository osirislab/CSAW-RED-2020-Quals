; During our CS archaeology quest we stumbled across this partially corrupted magnetic tape that seems to contain some code of the ancients:

(defun &(~)(if(< ~ |)~(+ (&(- ~ 1))(&(- ~ |)))))(&(*(let((% |)(@ $))(* % @))(let((^ |)(! $))(+ ^ !))))

; Apparently during the read-out of the tape two numbers were exchanged with the non-executing characters '|'' and '$'.
; Which integers do these two need to become to make the code return the value 832040?"
; Write the answer as flag{a,b} where “a” is the integer representing '|' and “b” is the integer representing '$'.
