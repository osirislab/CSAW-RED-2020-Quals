# Recursive
- Category: rev 
- Suggested Points: 50
- Distribute: prop_remote should be run on remote, proprietary (no-flag binary) should be given out. No Source code should be distributed.

# Description
A simple XOR reversing challenge. Players must read three key strings from the binary 
and xor them with each other to acquire the password.

# Deployment


# Flag
flag{fr3e_n_0p1n_so@rce_xd}

# Solution
When the keys are XOR'd together, the string 'mvsvds~l}tvem&xxbcabfai{' will be produced.
prop_remote will give the flag when this is entered.

# Potential Breakage
