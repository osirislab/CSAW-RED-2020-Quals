# Description

This is an easy forensics challenge provided by Dan Sanner at Pacific Northest 
National Laboratory. It was first used for the Pink Elephant Unicorn CTF held 
in Seattle between two and five years ago. 

Alice's email address is easy to find, the challenge here is to get used to 
not reading an entire packet capture to find a small piece of data. Strings 
works on this, or TCPFlow with grep, or a Wireshark filter. Find Alice's 
email address (alice_test@hotmail.com), and submit it to the challenge 
server to get the flag. I'm giving it 50 points. Nice, easy, non-guessy 
forensics challenge.

# TODO

Just needs to be tested once it's running in CTFd.
