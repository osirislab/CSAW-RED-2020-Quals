# Description

This is a combination of a crypto and a pwn challenge. Forge an 
admin's credential with an MD5 hash collision, and follow up 
with an easy ROP to get the flag. See the solver for details on 
where to get the tooling etc. I'm calling it misc because it 
bridges two categories.

The challenge is D&D themed because all good challenges are D&D themed. 
The spells are straight out of the Player's Handbook and the puns are 
the best D&D puns ever used in a CSAW RED 2020 CTF misc category.

# TODO

Just needs to be tested once it's running in CTFd. Also note that I have it running on port 8000, following the example of other challenges waiting to be assigned unique port numbers.
